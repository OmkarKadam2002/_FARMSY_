        <h2> üåê Information:</h2>
        <p> Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision
            about the farming strategy. Here, we have built a predictive model to recommend the most
            suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.
            Crop Prediction is one of the most important aspects of precision agriculture.
            Crop recommendations are based on a number of factors. Precision agriculture seeks to
            define these criteria on a site-by-site basis in order to address crop selection issues.
        </p>
        <h2>‚ùìWorking:</h2>
        <p> Complete all the parameters and the machine learning model will predict the most
            suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on the input values.

                        <p>This field represents the amount of Nitrogen (in kg/ha) present in the soil for
                            the crop. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient required for plant growth, and its
                            deficiency or excess can affect the growth as well as the yield of the crop.</p><br>

                            the crop. Phosphorus is another essential nutrient required for plant growth and
                            is important for processes such as energy transfer and photosynthesis.</p><br>

                            the crop. Potassium is also an essential nutrient required for plant growth and
                            plays a role in various physiological processes such as water regulation and
                            nutrient transport.</p><br>

                        <p>This field represents the soil pH during the crop's growing period. pH is a
                            measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil and can affect the
                            availability of nutrients for the crop.</p><br><br>

                            growing period. Temperature is an important environmental factor that can
                            affect crop growth and development, and different crops have different
                            temperature requirements for optimal growth.</p><br><br>

                            the crop's growing period. Humidity is another important environmental
                            factor that can affect crop growth, as high humidity can promote disease
                            and fungal growth.</p><br><br>
